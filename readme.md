Work in progress. contributions welcome.

### Getting stated

For an example check `webhook_test.go`. I will update this page as I finalize things.

Before you run `webhook_test.go` add a `config.json` file in the following format to root.

````
{
  "validation_token" : "a validation token you can choose",
  "page_access_token": "page access token generated by facebook"
}
````
